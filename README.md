A simple wired fencing scoring system.

The aim is to make it simple, rather than efficient or super precise.\
Towards that, the hardware is a LED display with a matching controller from adafruit,
and circuitpython is used vs e.g. C.

Note: foil only currently.

# installation
- Install circuitpython on the matrixportal S3 : https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-matrixportal-s3/install-circuitpython
- Prep the portal and led display : https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-matrixportal-s3/prep-the-matrixportal
- Copy code.py and the various bmp files onto the circuitpython drive.
- Fence.
